# Airbnb projects

Two separate group projects for school, focused on the website Airbnb. 

The first one is an analysis of price setting on Airbnb website, and the second one is a study on Airbnb users' behavior after the settlement of a new policy.

The data was scraped on Python using beautifulsoup and Selenium. It was then analyzed with pandas, numpy and folium librairies mainly.
